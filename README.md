# IPM
Code and data to run the associated Integral Projection Models (IPM) for _Plethodon montanus_

Each site (SPG, IMG, HG, BBT, CG) has its own file to run the IPMs (e.g., spg calculations runs IPMs for the site SPG).
The functions to run all site-specific IPMs are contained within Pmontanus demog funs.
The data for each site is contained within its own .Rdata file (e.g., spg ipm data)
